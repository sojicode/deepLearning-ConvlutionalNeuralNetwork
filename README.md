## DeepLearning - Convlutional Neural Network (CNNs)

Use CNNs to classify the CIFAR-10 image data: one of the most widely used benchmark datasets for image classification.

### Goal

Train a CNN model with the hyperparameter tuning and get the better predictions. 

### Hyperparameter Tuning

* Change the number of filters
* Change the size of filters 
* Change the size of stride 
* Add more Convolution layers
* Add more Fully Connected layers
* Add Dropout layers including regularization and removing layers
* Add BatchNormalization layers
